#logical operators are either "true or false" or "yes or no" or "0 or 1"
# equal to ==
# not equal to !=
# less than <
# greater than >
# less than and equal to <=
# greater than and equal to >=
 
# is 4 equal to 4?
# print(4==4)
# print(4!=4)
# print(4>3)
# print(3>6)
# print(3<=5)
# print(5>=4)

#application of logical operators
# hammad_age=4
# age_at_School=5
# print(hammad_age==age_at_School)

#input function and logical operator
age_at_School= 5
hammad_age=input("How old is hammad? ") #input function
print(type(hammad_age))
print(hammad_age==age_at_School) #logical operator
